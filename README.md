# some-kaggle-notebooks
A place to contain all the notebooks I create for kaggle competitions. Currently working through a few more of their tutorials to learn more about the machine learning algorithms, and methods involved. 

The link to the website in question https://www.kaggle.com.

During the weekends and some evenings I'll work on these competitions and tutorials. Hopefully by the end of the summer I'll have a few interesting notebooks to look at!
