# Purpose
To hold all of the work I have done compiling a list of beers brewed by companies owned by either Molson Coors or Miller Coors.

# Mistakes in the list
Give the complex web of ownerships in the beer world I am quite sure that I missed a few beers. On the flip side I may have included breweries that do not belong in this list, but I think that is unlikely.

# Description of the Data Collection
I first went to Molson Coors' website and navigated to the brands page at https://www.molsoncoors.com/brands/our-brands and then I used the Python program located at brands.py to scrape some information about the brands. All the information collected was placed into the brands.csv file.

Each brand in the brands.csv file was investigated to figure out what brewery owned it and verify that Molson Coors or Miller Coors owned that brewery. I then located the Beer Advocate (https://www.beeradvocate.com/) page for each brewery.

I then collected the data for every beer for that brewery and placed it in its own .csv file.

I now plan to put all the beers together in one large .csv file with the brewery listed in a separate column. For this I will use a jupyter notebook
